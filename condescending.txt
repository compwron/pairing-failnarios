Protagonist:	I really don't understand why I can't get this test passing.
Antagonist:	It must be because YOU introduced a bug.
            Protagonist:	Maybe, but I only added this code here, and none of the previous tests fail.
            Antagonist:	But YOU have been typing, I am sure MY test is good.
            Protagonist:	Well, maybe WE messed up in our design thinking.
            Antagonist:     You mean MY design, can't be, it has to be YOUR code.
