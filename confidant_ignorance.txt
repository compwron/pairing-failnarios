Protagonist:	I think we should raise an exception here.
Antagonist:	That's dumb, we should just return Null, let someone else deal with it.
Protagonist:	I'm usually in favor of giving information as early and as specific as possible.
Antagonist:	Seems like a waste of time to me, just more code to write.
Protagonist:	But how many times have you complained about not getting enough information with an error.
Antagonist:	Well, yeah, from Java itself, but we aren't writing a language, just a business app.
Protagonist:	I don't think that matters, if we can make it easier for someone later we should.
Antagonist:	If you insist, but I still think it's a waste of time.

Protagonist:	Let's try using "foo" to solve this.
Antagonist:	Hmmm, I don't think that works in Java.
Protagonist:	I'm pretty sure I've seen it used before.
Antagonist:	I doubt it, I know I've Googled it and it's just not supported.
Protagonist:	You must be thinking of "bar", let's just try "foo" and see what happens.
Antagonist:	Sigh.  Well, if you really must try, but I know it's a waste of time.

Protagonist: Here, let me write a test- I think there's an edge case left
Antagonist: No, the code works fine. Let's move on.
Protagonist: I think that when they're both zero, the function will return the wrong value. (give evidence for your case)
Antagonist: No, it works fine.
Protagonist: Here, let me write it
Antagonist: Fine, but it'll be green
