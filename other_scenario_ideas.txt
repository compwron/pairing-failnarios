1 keyboard for a pair (or other variation on inadequate physical setup)

Foreigner, can't understand accent (either direction)

Noisy pairing environment

Trying to give feedback to pair / pair gives you ridiculous feedback

Pair has body odor, what to do?

Pair doesn't understand value of formatting code properly (does this go under responsible_decisions.txt?)

Pair is unfamilliar / angry with tools (git, intellij, other)

responsible_decisions.txt (?) pair doesn't like making small / reasonabile - sized commits, wants to lump everything together

Been pairing for too long, should split / unwilling to move off a card

Inconsistent workstation setup. (one pair opens up emacs instead of intellij, etc.)

new role: aware pair who had been in a devolving client situation for a while; both pairs are familliar with codebase, tools. Corporate environment has an unproductive incentive structure, etc?

Several variations on how to articulate smells in pairing

pair keeps physically leaving without telling you where they're going or when they'll be back (real life, recent - requested)

Scenario with two aware pairs, and the imperfections which can be found in that setup.
- 2 aware-pairs: A and B. A is distracted (by phone or other), B doesn't notice that A is distracted. (real life, recent - requested)

Several variations on how to tell your pair that what they're doing is not okay: be able to express what the smell is, don't just smell it. (requested)

Talking someone up (and accidentally someone else down)
