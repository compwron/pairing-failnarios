1 keyboard for a pair

Foreigner, can't understand accent (either direction)

Noisy pairing environment

Trying to give feedback to pair / pair gives you ridiculous feedback

Pair has body odor, what to do?

Pair doesn't understand value of formatting code properly (does this go under responsible_decisions.txt?)

Pair is unfamilliar / angry with tools (git, intellij, other)

responsible_decisions.txt (?) pair doesn't like making small / reasonabile - sized commits, wants to lump everything together

Been pairing for too long, should split / unwilling to move off a card

Inconsistent workstation setup. (one pair opens up emacs instead of intellij, etc.)

new role: aware pair who had been in a devolving client situation for a while; both pairs are familliar with codebase, tools. Corporate environment has an unproductive incentive structure, etc?

How to articulate smells in pairing:
	- refactoring, why?
