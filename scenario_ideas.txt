Noisy pairing environment

Trying to give feedback to pair / pair gives you ridiculous feedback

Pair has body odor, what to do?

Pair doesn't understand value of formatting code properly (does this go under responsible_decisions.txt?)

Pair is unfamilliar / angry with tools (git, intellij, other)

responsible_decisions.txt (?) pair doesn't like making small / reasonabile - sized commits, wants to lump everything together
