You: Ok, so let's do ping-pong pairing. Have you done that before?
Other: I don't think that pairing is a good fit for this task. I would go faster on my own. 

2
Other:	This task is too simple to pair on
You: It's pretty simple but I think we can get some value from pairing. 
Other: Ok, but you're going to be really bored

Other:  We're just building boilerplate code, we don't need to pair on this. 
You:  Our team values pairing, and this will be over soon, so I think it's worth it
Other:	Ugh, this is a waste of developer time

4
Other: I don't need my hand held for this part. We should stop pairing. 
You: I'm not implying that you do. 
Other:	Well, I don't. You don't have to supervise me. 
You: I'm not supervising. We're pairing. I'm learning what you're doing and we're sharing the work.
Other:	Uh-huh, sure.
