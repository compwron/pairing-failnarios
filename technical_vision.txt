	Scenario - Stuck in the Mud
		Protagonist:	I think we should use an int here.
		Antagonist:	But we need to keep them in a collection so we will have to have an Object.
		Protagonist:	OK, then we can go with Integer.
		Antagonist:	Well, I was thinking of our own object.
		Protagonist:	That seems like YAGNI to me.  I see the need for Integer over int, but nothing more.
		Antagonist:	I really don't care, I want to create an object.
		Protagonist:	But it won't have any more kick than an Integer.
		Antagonist:	But that's what I thought of and it will be hard for me to conceptualize things if you change it.
