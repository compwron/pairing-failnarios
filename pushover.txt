	Scenario - Push Over
		Protagonist:	So, do you think we should use an int or an Integer.
		Antagonist:	I don't know, whatever you think.
		Protagonist:	And maybe we even will need our own object, but that might be YAGNI right now.
		Antagonist:	You have more experience, you really should just decide.
		Protagonist:	I guess I'll go with our own object then.
		Antagonist:	OK.
		Protagonist:	"codes a bit", That's just not working, it really is YAGNI.
		Antagonist:	OK.
