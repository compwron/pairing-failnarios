Scenarios for a developer pairing workshop. 


Instructions:
Read the exercise. 
What should you say next? 
What do you think the Other is feeling?
Is this scenario plausible?
What does it tell you about the client situation?

Feel free to commit new scenarios and/or send feedback :)

These workshop materials are intended to create good discussions, not to recommend how to deal with difficult situations; but some recommendations have snuck in. I don't think that the dialogue attributed to the "aware pair" role is always the best idea.

The newer scenarios primarily discuss the situation of pairing with a person who is not as strong at doing or valuing pairing in order to primarily accomplish story points rather than refactoring or training.

There is a section of "pairing guidelines" which tries to capture the outcomes of brainstorming sessions on this topic.
