Scenarios for a developer pairing workshop. 

Scenarios originally devised by: Wendy Istvanick

Instructions:
Read the exercise. 
What should you say next? 
What do you think the Other is feeling?
Is this scenario plausible?
What does it tell you about the client situation?

Feel free to commit new scenarios and/or send feedback :)
