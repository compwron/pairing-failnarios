Longer scenarios are easier to play (in general, 3-4 lines is too short; 15 is too long. Line length also mattters: 4 lines of multiple-sentence scenarios can be 'just right')

Discussion probably needs to be timeboxed

More context for scenarios is good

Most of these scenarios involve experienced-and-unwilling-to-change devs: expand beyond that. 

Fishbowl format is great: trade out one person every scenario

Some scenarios are too long or have too complex language

Perhaps discuss "pairing guidelines" or "desired outcomes of pairing" when the primary audience is JCs who have not been pairing much on a client-facing project yet.

Have participants write down what they think are the important points / advice / lessons on post-it notes during the session, put on board during/after. 

Running a mini-retro at the end is very valuable

Tokens for Other and Aware Pair are awesome - just two notecards to pass around, even. Person should not play one token twice in a row.
