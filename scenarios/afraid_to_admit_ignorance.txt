You: Ok, have you used Mockito before?
Other: I am awesome and know everything. Of course I have. It's dumb and we don't use it.
You: Ok, well we're using it here in order to mock Foo. Let's take a look so we can make it mock Bar here.
Other: (Doesn't understand) Ok, that makes sense.
You: Okay, do you want to drive?
Other: You can start.
You: Okay, so I'm mocking the first method on Bar... let's run it... ok, it's failing because we need to mock this method on Bar. Do you want to do that part?
Other: Ok... *copy-pastes previous line, pauses*
You: Can I help?
Other: No, I'm fine. 
You: *waits*
Other: So, what do I do here?
You: Let's mock this method, so we'll write a when() statement with Foo.method in it.
Other: Ok... *waits*
You: Here, let me show you. *takes keyboard*
Other: *takes back keyboard* No, let me do it. *pauses*
