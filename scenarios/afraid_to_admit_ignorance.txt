1. 
You: Ok, have you used spine.js before?
Other: I am awesome and know everything. Of course I have. It's dumb and we don't use it.
You: Ok, well we're using it here in order to (do foo), let's take a look so we can make it (do bar)
Other: (Doesn't understand) Ok, that makes sense

2. 
You: It's okay to admit that you don't know things, you know	
Other: Around here, that gets you fired. 
You: Er.
Other: So, let's just pretend that everything was my idea	

3. 
Other: We shouldn't use Mockito; it doesn't work.
You: Yes it does! See, right here! (Better response: "Well, on line 40 it looks like we're using it to mock Foo, and I think that's a parallel case to what we want to achieve")
Other: It doesn't work when you use it (shows wrong way to use it)	
You: Okay, I see what you're doing. Mockito is order sensitive, so you have to put the when() before the call to the method that uses the mock
Other: Uh-huh 
...
You: Okay, so let's use Mockito like we did before	
Other: (Makes same mistake again)
You: I think this is another order-based problem, does that make sense?
Other: Of course. (Does something wrong)
You: We need to put the when() before the usage of the method
Other: Okay... (does nothing)

Other is obviously having problems with the concept, and seems reluctant to say so. What do you do?
