You: Ok, have you used Mockito before?
Other: I am awesome and know everything. Of course I have. It's dumb and we don't use it.
You: Ok, well we're using it here in order to mock Foo. Let's take a look so we can make it mock Bar here.
Other: (Doesn't understand) Ok, that makes sense.
You: Okay, do you want to drive?
Other: You can start.
You: Okay, so I'm mocking the first method on Bar... let's run it... ok, it's failing because we need to mock this method on Bar. Do you want to do that part?
Other: Ok... *copy-pastes previous line, pauses*
You: Can I help?
Other: No, I'm fine.

Other: We shouldn't use Mockito; it doesn't work.
You: Yes it does! See, right here! (Better response: "Well, on line 40 it looks like we're using it to mock Foo, and I think that's a parallel case to what we want to achieve")
Other: It doesn't work when you use it (shows wrong way to use it)	
You: Okay, I see what you're doing. Mockito is order sensitive, so you have to put the when() before the call to the method that uses the mock
Other: Uh-huh 
...
You: Okay, so let's use Mockito like we did before	
Other: (Makes same mistake again)
You: I think this is another order-based problem, does that make sense?
Other: Of course. (Does something wrong)
You: We need to put the when() before the usage of the method
Other: Okay... (does nothing)

Other is obviously having problems with the concept, and seems reluctant to say so. What do you do?
