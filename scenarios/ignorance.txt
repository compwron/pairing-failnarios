Context: You are experienced with Mockito. The Other is reluctant to admit ignorance because they believe that it makes them look weak/ignorant.

1. 
You: Ok, have you used Mockito before?
Other: I have, but it's not useful in this codebase. 
You: Well, it's used in a few places in this codebase and I want to use it to mock Foo here.
Other: What is this? Did you put that in there? 
You: Not me personally, but it's used in a few places in the codebase and I think it would help us test Foo. Do you want to write this test?
Other: I could.
You: Okay, all yours.
Other: ...You can start.
You: Okay, so I'm mocking the first method on Bar... let's run it... ok, it's failing because we need to mock this method on Bar. Do you want to do that part?
Other: Ok... *pauses*
You: Can I help?
Other: No, I'm fine. 
You: *waits*
Other: So, what do I do here?
You: Let's mock this method, so we'll write a when() statement with Foo.method in it.
Other: Ok... *waits*
You: Here, let me show you. *takes keyboard*
Other: *takes back keyboard* No, let me do it. *pauses*

Context: You're not sure what the Other is doing and are worried about seeming incompetent / inexperienced

You: So, I know that we're working on card 42, but is this related to that?
Other: Yes.
You: Uh, what do you consider the next step with the card?
Other: I think we should add Foo to the mapper. Or... maybe we should add the columns to the database first. What do you think?
You: Uh. *pause* Either sounds good?
Other: Uh-huh.

3
Context: You are worried about being perceived as ignorant

Other: Do you understand this? 
You: Er. Well, I know that the database layer goes through Foo, and that we're changing it.
Other: But do you understand it?
You: Probably not. Can you tell me how it works?
Other: Okay, so we start in the controller...

4
Context: The Other seems unwilling to expose their ignorance, in an area you are unfamiliar with

Other: So then Foo magically authenticates the user.
You: How does the magic work?
Other: By magic. It's complicated, we don't need to discuss it.
You: We can put it off for later, but I really want to know how all the pieces work.
Other: Ugh, fine. So, Foo inherits from Bar, which has the Auth method.
You: But how does the Auth method work?
Other: Magic. I don't really know. No one really knows.
You: Maybe we could figure it out, and then show it to the team after standup sometime?
Other: Well, someone probably knows. 
You: We could ask them?
Other: We don't really need to know.

5
Context: You don't understand an aspect of the code which you've been working on with your pair for a while

You: How does Foo see this variable?
Other: We've been working with this for two days. I thought I explained this.
You: Er. Sorry about that. I thought I understood, but this new aspect of it makes me think I need more explanation.
Other:	Uh-huh.

6
Context: You were pairing, then the Other was out for a day, now they're back and catching up.

You: So it works because Foo picks up the global state here?	
Other: No, it comes in from the properties file.
You: Oops. I was assuming global state. I think we need to do some rewriting.
Other:	Argh, I was gone for one day and you've done it completely wrong.
