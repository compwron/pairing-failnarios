Context: You want to gently introduce concepts without pursuing them at the moment, so that a deeper discussion later will be more successful. It is just after standup and you've just started pairing for the day.

1 
You: Okay, so I'm going to be getting lunch around 12:15. But we can stop before then; I know you take lunch earlier.
Other: Oh no, it's no trouble, I can eat a little late today; I know that Mr. Manager really wants us to pair. 
You: Okay, I'm fine either way. I just don't want my pair to go hungry! Hungry pairs are less productive... So, about this code.
Other: Right, we were just adding a setter for Foo on Bar.

2 
You: Tomorrow I'll be getting in a little late; feel free to start without me. I don't want to hold up the pair.
Other: I get in early but I actually have a 10am meeting.... maybe we should just not start work on this card until afterwards. I can do something else for a while.
You: No, I know it's important to get this card done. Definitely work on it, just push your progress before you head to the meeting so I can keep working while you're out. 
Other:	I don't know if it'll be in a pushable state...
You: Well, you can just not plug it into the main execution path, or toggle it off. I'd really like us to keep working on this.
Other: Maybe I'll just push it commented out. 
You:	Okay, sounds like a plan. Don't forget to leave me a commit message!

You: Okay, so we need to add Foo to Bar, but only if this one attribute of Foo is greater than this other attribute of Foo. I think. Is that what it looks like to you?
Other:	Kind of. I think it's not about the relationship of the attributes, but the overall value of the attributes. 
You: Hmm, that makes sense but I don't see it in the code yet. Could you point? 
Other: It's around here somewhere; give me a minute.
You: Oh man, someone just broke the build... it's a good thing that we're not at a commit point, or we'd have to wait to check in! I hope they get it fixed soon. So, about this code... have you found the attributes?
Other: They're over here in the calculation about Bar.

4. 
Context: Trying to encourage good commit messages, frequent pushes, and not postponing working on code until both pairs are present.

You: I know you have to go, so I promise to push before I leave so you can work on it before I get in tomorrow morning, because I know you're in early.
Other: Okay, thanks. 
You: I'll leave you a super-informative commit message so that what I was doing makes sense even if I leave something strange or half-finished in the code.
Other:	Okay, see you tomorrow.

You: What time are you heading out today? I don't want to make you late to anything. 
Other: It'll be okay, I'll just leave when I have to. 
You: Okay, but since we're working on your machine, I'd like to make sure that we get the code pushed at a convenient time for you, so I can work on it tomorrow when you're out.
Other:	Well, I'll only be at the dentist part of the day; I can just work on it and push it from home.
You: Yeah totally, I know that you're doing a half-day from home. But I want access to the code too, so I can make sure that I understand everything that we did.
Other: Okay, lets push now. I'll be online tomorrow if you have any questions. 
You: Sounds good.
