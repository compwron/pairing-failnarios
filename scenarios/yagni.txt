Other:	But we need to keep them in a collection so we will have to have an Object.
You:	Good point. Let's go with Integer, then. 
Other:	Well, I was thinking of our own object.
You:	That seems like YAGNI to me.  I see the need for Integer over int, but nothing more.
Other:	I really don't care, I want to create an object.
You:	But what advantage will it give us?
Other:	Well, it'll make the code more extensible and easier to understand
