You: Okay, so it's your turn to write a test
Other: Cool, so we want Foo to do Bar... *typing*
You: Uh, I think someone is here to see you?
Third: Hi, um, I just have a question, it'll only take a second...
Other:	Ok, I have to deal with this. Can you finish the test?
You: Yeah, no problem
Other: Ok. So, Third, is this about Initiative A?
You:	*writing code*
Third: So, if stream one of initiative A is set for next year...
Other:	Then we have a release cycle mismatch with initiative B, I see... okay, let's draw a diagram real quick
Third: And ManagerDude says that we have to have it in by the release before, and I don't see how that could work
Other: Hmm, so we'll need toggles...
You: Guys, this is really distracting, how long will it take?
Other: Er, you should probably take a coffee break. Sorry.
