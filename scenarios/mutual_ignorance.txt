Context: You are both relatively unfamiliar with the codebase and trying to implement functionality while pairing. 

You: What are you doing?
Other: Looking for where to implement Foo's service call.
You: How do you know where it should go?
Other: I don't. Do you?
You: No. I agree, lets go look for where Bar hits the service. Maybe that will give us an idea for where to put Foo.
Other: What service does it hit?
You: Hopefully the code will clarify that in Bar.
