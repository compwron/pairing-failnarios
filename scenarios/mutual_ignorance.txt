Context: You are both relatively unfammiliar with the codebase and trying to implement functionality while pairing. 

You: What are you doing?
Other: Looking for where to implement 'foo'
You: How do you know where it should go?
Other: I don't. Do you?
You: Nope, no idea. I agree, lets go look for where (thing does bar), because that's parallel functionality to foo and maybe will give us an idea of where to put it.
