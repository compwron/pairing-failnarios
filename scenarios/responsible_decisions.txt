Other: Why are we merging this code? We should just overrride their changes. 
You: I'm sure they made these changes on purpose, we should work on merging with them
Other: They shouldn't have been changing the code that we were changing.
You: Let's go talk to them and we can work it out

Other:	We don't need to run the tests before pushing; I'm sure it works
You: No, we need to run the tests

You: Kick them off and we can take a coffee break
Other: No, it's pointless. Let's just kick them off. 
You: But we don't want to inconvenience the other devs if it goes red

Other: 	No, we need to hurry up
