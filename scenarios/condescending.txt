Context: You are pairing with the client, trying to fix a bug. The Other is convinced that their code is very good, that you are ignorant. They may feel threatened by your presenece; maybe they think that you being here is evidence that someone thinks that they can't do their job. 

You:	I really don't understand why I can't get this test passing.
Other:	It must be because YOU introduced a bug.       
You:	Maybe, but I only added this code here, and none of the previous tests fail.            
Other:	But YOU have been typing, I am sure MY test is good.
You:	Well, maybe we messed up in our design thinking.
Other:  You mean MY design, can't be, it has to be YOUR code.
You: 	Well, that's totally possible. No one is perfect. Can you help me find where the error is?
Other:	No, it's YOUR error, YOU find it. I'm glad you realize that YOU're wrong.
You:	Aw come on, help me find the error. It looks like it's being caused by a null pointer in Foo... what does Foo do?
Other:	Foo does Bar, but that's MY code... the error must be in YOUR code.
You:	Can you navigate us to Foo, so I can look at it and learn more about how the code works?
