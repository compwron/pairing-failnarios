Context: You are pairing with a client dev who has not paired very much before and is not convinced of the value. The Other is a little uncomfortable with sharing a computer, genuinely unconvinced of the value of pairing, and not experienced with pairing.

You: Ok, so let's do ping-pong pairing. Have you done that before?
Other: I don't think that pairing is a good fit for this task. I would go faster on my own. 
You: I think this is an ok task to pair on... we're just going to write a few tests and fix a bug. 
Other:	Yeah, it's just a bug. This task is too simple to pair on.
You: It's pretty simple but I think we can get some value from pairing. Bugs can be tricky.
Other: Ok, but you're going to be really bored. This is super-easy. Really, totally boring.
You: That's okay. Our team values pairing, and this will be over soon, so I think it's worth it
Other:	Ugh, this is a waste of developer time.
You: Here, let me navigate to the class that you said is causing the problem.
Other: I don't need my hand held for this part. We should stop pairing. 
You: I'm not implying that you do. 
Other:	Well, I don't. You don't have to supervise me. 
You: I'm not supervising. We're pairing. I'm learning what you're doing and we're sharing the work.
Other:	Uh-huh, sure.
