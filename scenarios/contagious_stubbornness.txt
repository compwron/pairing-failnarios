Sometimes when you are frustrated by your pair's behavior, you find yourself becoming grumpy. Take a break when you need to. How often is it ok to take a break? Often enough to not say "argh"

You: Arrrrrrgh
Other:	What?
You: Er, nothing. Er, I'm going to go get some coffee. Would you like anything?
