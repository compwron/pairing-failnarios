Context: There's only one screen

You: I can't see, can you increase the font? 
Other: Not really, I don't know how. 
You: This is pretty difficult to see and I want to be able to keep up with you, so let's take a minute to look at it. 
Other:	Ugh, I'm not sure it's possible. And then there's less code on the screen.
You: I'll try to clean my glasses some more but let's just go to the Preferences menu and look for it.
Other: How about I can just tell you what's going on instead.
