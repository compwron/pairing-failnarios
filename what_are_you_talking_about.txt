	Scenario - Assuming You're Understood
		Protagonist:	Here's a red bar for you.
		Antagonist:	Got it.  I'll just do this quickly and I am sure you will like the result.
		Protagonist:	I'm not really following what you are doing.
		Antagonist:	I'm sure it will be clear when it's done, just wait a few minutes.
		Protagonist:	Maybe, but it seems like you have some complex logic in your head that you may need to talk me through.
		Antagonist;	Just wait, I'm sure you will see it.  (pause)  Now - that should make it all clear.
		Protagonist:	Nope, not really.
